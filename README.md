# Containerlab-Topologies
Network topologies implemented in Containerlab for academic research and experimentation.

This repository contains a collection of network topologies implemented with [Containerlab](https://containerlab.dev).
It was developed as part of my diploma thesis at NTUA **Study and Evaluation of Containerlab for Network Topology Emulation**.

## Contents
- `topologies/` â†’ Each folder contains all necessary files, including YAML and configuration files, for a different network simulation. The topologies use different routing protocols and network mechanism such as RIP, OSPF, BGP, VXLAN, EVPN, ECMP, LINUX BRIDGES, OVS SWITCH.
